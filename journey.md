# My journey towards becoming a Full stack Web Dev.
### Stack learnt till now ( Date: 27-01-2024 )
HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript

## Phase 1 ( Learning the Basics)

Started with the Web Dev course by Angela Yu. I must say that the front end part was pretty solid. So, completed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Basics and to some level intermediate stuff as well

### My first Roadblock
It will be very unusual if you set on such a long journey and don't face a single roadblock. With me, it was no exception as well.
The first roadblock was, you guessed it right, "The Tutorial Hell". I saw many videos on YouTube introducing me to tutorial hell and how to avoid it but still couldn't avoid it. I thought that doing practice along with the course will be sufficient, and trust me, that course by Angela Yu does have lots of exercises, but it still not enough. And, the interesting thing is that you don't realise that it isn't enough unless you try to build something of your own, especially some project involving dynamic page manipulation and DOM manipulation.

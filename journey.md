# My journey towards becoming a Full stack Web Dev.
### Stack learnt till now ( Date: 27-01-2024 )
HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript

## Phase 1 ( Learning the Basics)

Started with the Web Dev course by Angela Yu. I must say that the front end part was pretty solid. So, completed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Basics and to some level intermediate stuff as well

The first roadblock was, you guessed it right, "The Tutorial Hell". I saw many videos on YouTube introducing me to tutorial hell and how to avoid it.
